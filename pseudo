  - make sure only 5 input fields are active

if enter button has been clicked:
 - check if the word is valid
  - if not, delete
  - if yes, start testing logic:
    - go through each letter
    - is the letter equal to the letter in the word at the same position?
     - yes: make green
     - no: check if letter in word 
       - if yes: make yellow

make next 5 input fields active

if two same letters in input word:
check if lettercount is more than 1 in chosen word
if yes: proceed as usual
if no: check if one letter would be green
      if no: ignore one, make other yellow 
      if yes: ignore one, make other green
